        <h2>The Quantum Nature of Light</h2>
        <p>Einstein proposed that light is made up of particles called photons. Each photon carries energy proportional to its frequency, described by the equation E = hf, where h is Planck’s constant and f is the frequency of light.</p>

        <h2>Photon-Electron Interaction</h2>
        <p>According to Einstein, when a photon hits a metal surface, its energy is transferred to an electron. If the photon’s energy is above a certain threshold, the electron is ejected from the metal's surface, demonstrating the particle nature of light.</p>

        <h2>Impact of the Explanation</h2>
        <p>Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. It was a pivotal moment in the development of quantum theory, showing the particle-like behavior of light, alongside its wave-like properties.</p>
