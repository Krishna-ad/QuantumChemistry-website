        <h2>Atomic Orbitals</h2>
        <p>Schrödinger's equation is used to determine the wave functions of electrons in atoms, which form the atomic orbitals. These orbitals describe the probable locations of electrons around an atom and play a crucial role in chemistry and molecular bonding.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Tunneling</h2>
        <p>Schrödinger's equation is also vital in understanding quantum tunneling, where particles move through potential barriers. This phenomenon is crucial in processes like nuclear fusion in stars, and in technologies such as tunnel diodes and scanning tunneling microscopes.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p>The Schrödinger equation forms the theoretical foundation for quantum computing. It describes the behavior of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computers, and explains how they can exist in superpositions of states, enabling massive parallel computations.</p>
