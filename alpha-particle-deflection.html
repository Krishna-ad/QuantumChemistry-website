        <h2>What is Alpha Particle Deflection?</h2>
        <p>Alpha particle deflection occurs when positively charged alpha particles are scattered by a nucleus. The degree of deflection provides insight into the structure of the atom.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>When alpha particles are directed at a thin gold foil, most pass through, but some are deflected at large angles, indicating the presence of a dense, positively charged nucleus in the atom.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Atomic Theory</h2>
        <p>The unexpected deflections led Rutherford to propose the nuclear model of the atom, showing that atoms have a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons.</p>
