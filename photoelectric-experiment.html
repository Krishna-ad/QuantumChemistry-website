        <h2>Experiment Setup</h2>
        <p>The photoelectric effect experiment involves shining light on a metal surface and observing the emission of electrons. This phenomenon was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in the 1880s.</p>

        <h2>Einstein's Explanation</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1921, showed that light is composed of particles called photons. These photons carry energy proportional to their frequency.</p>
