        <h2>What is the Uncertainty Principle?</h2>
        <p>Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. The more precisely one is measured, the less precisely the other can be known.</p>

        <h2>Position and Momentum</h2>
        <p>According to the uncertainty principle, measuring the position of an electron more accurately increases the uncertainty in its momentum, and vice versa. This limitation is not due to the imperfection of instruments but is a fundamental property of nature.</p>

        <h2>Example of Uncertainty</h2>
        <p>In quantum mechanics, particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The uncertainty principle is a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality, where the wave nature of particles introduces limitations in measurement accuracy.</p>
