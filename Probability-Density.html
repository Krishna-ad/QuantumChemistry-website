      <h2>What is Probability Density?</h2>
      <p>In quantum mechanics, the probability density is a measure of the likelihood of finding a particle in a specific location. It is derived from the wave function, represented by <em>Ψ</em>.</p>

      <h2>The Role of the Wave Function</h2>
      <p>The wave function, <em>Ψ(x, t)</em>, describes the quantum state of a system. The square of its absolute value, |Ψ(x, t)|², gives the probability density of finding a particle at position <em>x</em> at time <em>t</em>.</p>

      <h2>Visualizing Probability Density</h2>
      <p>Probability density can be visualized as a graph where higher peaks indicate a greater likelihood of finding the particle. For example, in the ground state of a hydrogen atom, the probability density is highest near the nucleus.</p>
