        <h2>The Uncertainty Equation</h2>
        <p>The uncertainty principle is mathematically expressed as: <br><strong>Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ / 2</strong><br> where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and ℏ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck’s constant.</p>

        <h2>Implication of the Formula</h2>
        <p>This formula shows that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum has a lower bound. The more accurately we know one of the quantities, the less accurately we can know the other.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Fluctuations</h2>
        <p>The mathematical formulation also implies that quantum particles, such as electrons, cannot have both a perfectly defined position and momentum. The inherent quantum fluctuations prevent simultaneous precise measurements of both quantities.</p>
