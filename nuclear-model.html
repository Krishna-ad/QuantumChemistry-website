        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Rutherford's nuclear model, proposed in 1911, was a result of the Gold Foil Experiment. It suggested that atoms have a small, dense nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.</p>

        <h2>Structure of the Nucleus</h2>
        <p>The nucleus, located at the center of the atom, contains positively charged protons. The electrons move around the nucleus in relatively vast empty spaces.</p>

        <h2>Impact and Legacy</h2>
        <p>Rutherford’s model replaced the "plum pudding model" and paved the way for future atomic models, including Bohr’s model and quantum mechanical models of the atom.</p>
