        <h2>Quantized Energy Levels</h2>
        <p>Bohr proposed that electrons occupy discrete energy levels around the nucleus. These levels are quantized, meaning electrons can only exist in specific orbits and not in between them.</p>

        <img src="electron-energy-levels.jpg" alt="Electron Energy Transitions">
        <h2>Electron Transitions</h2>
        <p>When electrons absorb or emit energy, they jump between these quantized energy levels. This process results in the emission or absorption of light with specific wavelengths, explaining atomic spectra.</p>

        <h2>Radiation and Spectral Lines</h2>
        <p>Electrons emit radiation in the form of light when they drop from a higher energy level to a lower one. These transitions produce discrete spectral lines, which are unique to each element.</p>
