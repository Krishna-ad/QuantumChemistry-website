        <h2>Hydrogen Atom Spectrum</h2>
        <p>Bohr’s model successfully explained the spectral lines of hydrogen. By quantizing the energy levels, it predicted the wavelengths of light emitted when electrons transition between these levels, forming the hydrogen spectrum.</p>

        <h2>Laser Technology</h2>
        <p>The Bohr model’s explanation of electron transitions between energy levels is foundational in laser technology. By stimulating atoms to transition between specific energy levels, lasers emit focused light with high precision.</p>

        <h2>Atomic Spectroscopy</h2>
        <p>Bohr's model helped establish the principles of atomic spectroscopy, which involves measuring the light absorbed or emitted by atoms. This is used for identifying elements and analyzing their concentration in various samples.</p>
