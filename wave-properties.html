        <h2>Types of Waves</h2>
        <p>Waves can be classified as mechanical (like sound) or electromagnetic (like light). Mechanical waves require a medium, while electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics of Waves</h2>
        <p>Key properties of waves include wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and wave speed. These properties help us understand the energy and behavior of waves.</p>

        <h2>Wave Interference</h2>
        <p>When two or more waves meet, they can interfere with each other, either amplifying or canceling out. This phenomenon is essential in understanding wave behavior in various contexts.</p>
