        <h2>What is Wave-Particle Duality?</h2>
        <p>Wave-particle duality is the concept that every particle or quantum entity can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This phenomenon is central to quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h2>Double-Slit Experiment</h2>
        <p>The double-slit experiment demonstrated wave-particle duality by showing that light and electrons can create interference patterns, a behavior typical of waves, while also acting as particles.</p>
